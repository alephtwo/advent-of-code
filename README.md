# Advent of Code 2021

Solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
> variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
> programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview
> prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to
> challenge each other.

If you're solving the puzzles yourself, please don't read this code! It
contains solutions that you could use, and that ruins the spirit of the game.

I will frequently upload a scuffed solution that produces a correct answer
and then refine it over a series of commits. I try to add documentation from
the problem so that in the future this can be used as an absolute reference
for what the problems were at the time.
